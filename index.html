            Responsive web design is an approach to web development that ensures optimal user experience across various devices and screen sizes. By employing flexible grids and layouts, along with media queries, websites can dynamically adjust their design and content presentation, allowing seamless navigation on desktops, tablets, and smartphones. This adaptability not only enhances accessibility but also addresses the diverse ways users access information, making responsive design an essential practice for modern web development.
